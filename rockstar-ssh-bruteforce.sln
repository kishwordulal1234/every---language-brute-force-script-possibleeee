My world is a configuration
Host is nothing
Port is 22
User is nothing
Wordlist is nothing
Threads are 4
Timeout is 10

Listen to your heart
Shout "Starting SSH brute force"
Shout "Host: " + Host
Shout "Port: " + Port
Shout "User: " + User
Shout "Threads: " + Threads
Shout "Timeout: " + Timeout

My world is a wordlist file
Open wordlist file at Wordlist
My world is the passwords
Build the passwords up

While wordlist file is not empty
  Read a line from wordlist file
  Put the line into the passwords
  Shout "Loaded " + the passwords + " passwords"

My world is a result
The result is nothing

My world is the workers
Build the workers up

While the workers are less than Threads
  Create a worker called the workers
  The worker's mission is to try passwords
  Increment the workers

Listen to your heart
If the result is not nothing
  Shout the result
  Break it down

Shout "No valid credentials found"

The mission to try passwords is
  My world is a password
  While the passwords are not empty
    Take a password from the passwords
    If the password is right
      Put "[SUCCESS] " + User + ":" + password into the result
      Break it down
    Wait

Is the password right?
  My world is a socket
  Build the socket up
  Try to open the socket
  If the socket is open
    Close the socket
    Give back yes
  Else
    Give back no
